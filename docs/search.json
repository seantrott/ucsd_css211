Students may collaborate on labs with each other and seek help from their TA/instructor.\nConcept quizzes (20%): 4 short quizzes, held over Canvas, designed to test and improve conceptual intuitions about course topics.\nMidterm (25%): A paper midterm held in-class testing knowledge of course material.\nFinal project (35%): A rigorous replication (and possible extension) of existing empirical work (published or otherwise) in a student’s discipline of interest. Final projects should be completed independently; students will turn in both a written report and present their work in a short in-class presentation the final week of class. (A rubric will be provided separately.)\n\nRounding\nMy course policy is not to round up grades for two reasons:\n\nIf rounding is applied selectively (i.e., only to students who ask), it is unfair to other students.\n\nIf rounding is applied across the board, it simply redefines the boundary between two letter grades (e.g., making an 89% the cut-off for an A-)."

    "text": "Using AI\nTools like ChatGPT can be incredibly helpful for learning to code (or speeding up the process). At the same time, I think it’s crucial to learn the foundational skills and concepts that will allow you to use these tools to their full potential. That is the main motivation for having an in-class midterm: ultimately, I cannot force anyone to complete homework on their own without using ChatGPT (or equivalent tools), and I wouldn’t even claim that people shouldn’t consult ChatGPT for additional help or questions; but in order to perform well on the midterm, you will still need to learn the concepts."
