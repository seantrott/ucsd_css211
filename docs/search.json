    "text": "Why R?\n\nR is a programming language used to perform statistical analysis, wrangle data, make data visualizaitons, and more.\n\nR is certainly not the only way to analyze data, but it‚Äôs a useful tool in your toolbox for a couple reasons.\n\n\nR has excellent packages (lme4) for running analyses with mixed effects models.\nR has the tidyverse, a collection of packages for writing really clean code to wrangle, summarize, and visualize data.\n\nThe tidyverse includes ggplot, one of the best plotting packages I‚Äôve ever used.\n\nR is integrated with platforms like RStudio, which enable creation of sharable code, websites, and slides (like these)."
