title: "CSS 211 Final Project)"
---


The primary goal of the **final project** is to *reproduce* the analysis and results from a published paper (or preprint) in your area of interest. Alternatively/additionally, students are allowed (but not required) to conduct an *original* analysis on a publicly available dataset (or multiple datasets).

## Project guidelines and expectations

Your **deliverable** will be a *report* (and short *presentation*, delivered in class). The report (*30 points total*) should consist of the following sections (roughly):

| Section | Points | Description | Example 1| 
| --------------- | ---- | ---------- | -------- | 
| Introduction |  3 | What dataset are you looking at? Where/how was it created? What was the original paper your analysis is based on? | Dataset about which construction people use in the [dative alternation](http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Dative_alternation): do they use NP ("She gave the man the box") or PP ("She gave the box to the man"). I will ask which features predict the use of one construction vs. the other. Originally published in [Bresnan et al. (2007)](https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_58830).| 
| Data |  8 |  Descriptive statistics about the dataset: number of rows/columns, central tendency (mean/median/mode) of key variables, variability of key variables, any missing values, etc. Should also include details of **cleaning** or **merging** datasets, should you need to do that. | The [dativeSimplified](https://rdrr.io/cran/languageR/man/dativeSimplified.html) dataset contains 903 observations with 5 variables; it was created by examining transcriptions of conversational data from Switchboard. No cleaning was required. | 
| Visualizations | 8 | Reproduction of figures from original paper; alternatively, 2-3 *original visualizations* showing specific patterns or features you'd like to highlight. Each visualization should be accompanied by a short (1-2 sentences) description of what you think it shows. | Boxplot showing **length** of the *theme* argument when recipient is realized as a noun phrase vs. prepositional phrase. Barplot showing proportion of **NP** realizations depending on animacy of recipient. | 
| Analyses |  8| Reproduction of analyses from original paper; alternatively, 2-3 *original analyses* using methods discussed in class (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression etc.) to address your question. Each analysis should be accompanied by a short (1-3 sentences) *interpretation*. Should also include **evaluation** of your model somehow, e.g., $R^2$, AIC, etc. | Logistic regression predicting **realization** (NP vs. PP) from Animacy and Length. Compare AIC of this model to a model omitting each variable in turn. | 
| Limitations | 2 | Discuss any limitations to your approach. If it is a reproduction of published work, discuss any discrepancies; if it's original work, discuss any issues with your decisions.  | Variables could be inter-related; also only 4 predictor variables total. |  
| Conclusion |  1 | Drawing a conclusion about the dataset and the questions you posed. | An NP realization is more likely for *longer themes*.| 


The presentation will constitute an additional *5 points* of your final project grade. Presentations will be relatively short (~5 minutes), so the key thing will be to summarize the research question(s), display a key figure, and walk through an analysis.



## Advice for finding a result to reproduce

Finding a result to reproduce can be the hardest part, since it depends on finding papers with *publicly available datasets*. I recommend working *iteratively* here: 

1. Start by finding some papers that interest you (and have analyses you think you can reproduce).
2. Determine whether any of them have publicly available data. 
3a. If they do, choose one of those papers. 
3b. If they don't, return to (1). 

More advice on the search process is below.

### Start with recent, computational papers

Look for papers published in the last 3-5 years that use computational methods, statistical analysis, or data visualization. Recent papers are more likely to have accessible data and code.

### Check for open science practices

Prioritize papers that include:

- Links to datasets (often in supplementary materials or data repositories)
- Code repositories (GitHub, OSF, etc.)
- Clear methodology sections that explain analytical steps
- Papers with "reproducibility" badges or statements

### Good places to search:

- Journal-specific repositories (e.g., PLOS ONE, Behavior Research Methods, Nature Scientific Data)
- Preprint servers (arXiv, bioRxiv, SocArXiv) often have more accessible materials
- Your course readings or papers cited in class
- Papers from faculty in your department

### Consider scope

Choose a paper where you can reproduce:

- Anywhere from 2-4 specific analyses or figures. 
- Results using a subset of the data.
- Key findings using similar methods on comparable data

## Advice for finding datasets

Some students may wish to conduct an *original* analysis on a publicly available dataset. This can be more challenging, since it requires coming up with an original research question of theoretical interest. But if you're having trouble identifying a suitable paper (see above), you can always go this route. 

Here, your strategy will involve finding a suitable dataset or *multiple datasets* that you want to combine. You'll want to make sure this is accessible in a format you can read in and work with (e.g., a `csv` file).

Some useful starting points:

| Dataset | Social Science Domain | Description | Accessing |
| ------ | ---- | ---------- | ------- |
| World Bank Open Data | Economics / Global Development | Contains time series data for **many domains**, such as agricultural development, rural poverty, carbon emissions, and much, much more. | [Link to Data Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/); can browse by "indicator"; may require merging datasets for more information. |
| [World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021) | Economics / Global Development | Dataset about global happiness scores; might need to be merged with other datasets to ask useful questions. | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021)|
| World Energy Consumption | Economics / Climate | Contains time series data about consumption of **energy** and **electricity**. | [Link on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption) |
| SCARFS (Spontaneous, controlled, acts of reference between friends and strangers) | Linguistics/Communication | Data about friends and strangers playing the game **Taboo**, which clues they gave, and whether a trial was correct. | [GitHub Link](https://github.com/seantrott/scarfs) |
| Linguistic norms | Linguistics/Communication | Many psycholinguistic norm datasets, including concreteness, age of acquisition, iconicity, and more, are available online (including for this class!) | [Concreteness paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-013-0403-5), [Iconicity paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-023-02112-6) |
| [California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices) | Economics | Information about the median house value for different districts in California. | [Link on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices). |
| [Student alcohol consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption?select=student-por.csv) | Public Health | Information about student behavior, including alcohol consumption and more. |  [Link on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption?select=student-por.csv). |
