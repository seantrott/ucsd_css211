title: "CSS 211 Schedule"
---


This is a tentative schedule of which topics I plan to cover. Note that while all lectures will have an interactive component, Fridays are reserved for more hands-on labs—typically involving a CSS-relevant dataset—with active participation encouraged. 

Readings are option; "ISLR" refers to ["Introduction to Statistical Learning in R" (James et al.), which can be downloaded here](https://www.statlearning.com/).
